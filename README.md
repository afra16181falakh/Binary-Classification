Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a binary classification model using machine learning techniques. The aim is to classify data into one of two categories. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions using various algorithms and techniques.

Features

	•	Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset for training.
	•	Model Training: Train different binary classification models.
	•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	•	Predictions: Make predictions on new data.

Tech Stack

	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
